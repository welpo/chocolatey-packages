    <summary>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in</summary>
    <description>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in. Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or in the `docs/content` folder of the repository.

This tool and the template engine it is using ([Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera)) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

### List of features

- Single binary
- Syntax highlighting
- Sass compilation
- Assets co-location
- (Basic currently) multilingual site suport
- Image processing
- Themes
- Shortcodes
- Internal links
- External link checker
- Table of contents automatic generation
- Automatic header anchors
- Aliases
- Pagination
- Custom taxonomies
- Search with no servers or any third parties involved
- Live reload
- Deploy on many platforms easily: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare
- Breadcrumbs

### Breaking
- `get_file_hash` is removed, use `get_hash` instead. Arguments do not change
- Replace libsass by a Rust implementation: [grass](https://github.com/connorskees/grass). See https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes
for breaking changes with libsass: look for "beginning in Dart Sass"
- Merge settings for the default language set in the root of `config.toml` and in the `[languages.{default_lang}]` section. 
This will error if the same keys are defined multiple times
- Code blocks content are no longer included in the search index
- Remove built-ins shortcodes
- Having a file called `index.md` in a folder with a `_index.md` is now an error
- Ignore temp files from vim/emacs/macos/etc as well as files without extensions when getting colocated assets
- Now integrates the file stem of the original file into the processed images filename: {stem}.{hash}.{extension}

- Add `text` alias for plain text highlighting (before, only `txt` was used)
