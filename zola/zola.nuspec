    <summary>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in</summary>
    <description>A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in. Documentation is available on [its site](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) or
in the `docs/content` folder of the repository.

This tool and the template engine it is using ([Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera)) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.

### List of features

- Single binary
- Syntax highlighting
- Sass compilation
- Assets co-location
- (Basic currently) multilingual site suport
- Image processing
- Themes
- Shortcodes
- Internal links
- External link checker
- Table of contents automatic generation
- Automatic header anchors
- Aliases
- Pagination
- Custom taxonomies
- Search with no servers or any third parties involved
- Live reload
- Deploy on many platforms easily: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare
- Breadcrumbs

    <releaseNotes>## 0.18.0 (2023-12-18)

- Fix LFI in `zola serve`
- Do not panic when root directory or config file not found
- Fix base_url link attributes in atom templates
- Use all authors for atom templates
- Always sort page/section assets by filename
- Allow setting attributes to lazy load all images from Config.toml
- Fix HTML generated in class based highlighting with line numbers
- Add a `replace_re` filter
- Speed up `zola check` and only checks external links once, even if present in multiple languages
- Add `search.index_format` into the serialized config in the templates
- Add --force flag in `zola serve` if the directory is not empty
- Add `ignored_static` to the config to ignore specific files from the static directory
- Add Hungarian support for search
- Actually remove codeblocks from search index
- Fix taxonomies missing lang in sitemap

## 0.17.2 (2023-03-19)

- Fix one more invalid error with colocated directories
- Revert "Recognize links starting with `www` as external for the link checker" as they won't be external links in practice
- Use page.summary for atom.xml if available
- Fix cachebusting not working with binary files

## 0.17.1 (2023-02-24)

- Fix bugs with colocated directories in the root `content` directory
- Fix `zola serve` not  respecting `preserve_dotfiles_in_output`
- Add `generate_feed` field to the `section` object in templates

## 0.17.0 (2023-02-16)

### Breaking
- `get_file_hash` is removed, use `get_hash` instead. Arguments do not change
- Replace libsass by a Rust implementation: [grass](https://github.com/connorskees/grass). See https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes
for breaking changes with libsass: look for "beginning in Dart Sass"
- Merge settings for the default language set in the root of `config.toml` and in the `[languages.{default_lang}]` section. 
This will error if the same keys are defined multiple times
- Code blocks content are no longer included in the search index
- Remove built-ins shortcodes
- Having a file called `index.md` in a folder with a `_index.md` is now an error
- Ignore temp files from vim/emacs/macos/etc as well as files without extensions when getting colocated assets
- Now integrates the file stem of the original file into the processed images filename: {stem}.{hash}.{extension}

### Other

- Add `get_taxonomy_term` function
- Add `slugify.paths_keep_dates` option
- Add command to generate shell completions
- Fix link generation to co-located assets other than images
- Add `get_hash` Tera function
- Minify CSS and JS embedded in HTML
- Fix slow image processing
- Fix `current_url` in taxonomy term
- Add new flag `zola serve --no_port_append` to give the ability to remove port from base url
- `config.markdown` is now available in templates
- Add `preserve_dotfiles_in_output` option in the config
- Add Elasticlunr JSON output for the search index
- Add sorting by slug for pages
- Enable locale date formatting for the Tera `date` filter
- Cachebust fingerprint is now only 20 chars long
- Add `text` alias for plain text highlighting (before, only `txt` was used)
- Adds a new field to `page`: `colocated_path` that points to the folder of the current file being rendered if it's a colocated folder. None otherwise.
- Add `author` as a first-class property to the config and `authors` to pages
- Allows using external URL for `redirect_to`
- Recognize links starting with `www` as external for the link checker
